Outpatient scheduling and preparation for appointments. Performing ordered ultrasounds. Providing the best possible care for every single patient. Collecting all vital patient clinical data and producing a quality sonographic study to aid in a thorough interpretation and diagnosis by the department radiologists.AccomplishmentsI pride myself in being a dependable and trustworthy coworker. The success of our department is centered around teamwork and communication and it has been a great great experience to contribute to that. Skills UsedI believe that I am a very observative person, which is a very good trait when working around patients who can't always express what they need or how exactly they feel. I am also a very positive person and I think a job in health care shouldn't solely be technical or business-like. We are supposed to make people feel better and just a smile or a few comforting words can go a long way. I feel that I am a very efficient worker and when it comes to the imaging process I perform every ultrasound to the best of my knowledge and ability. I do this by utilizing all possible patient positions and having a thorough understanding of anatomy, physiology, and ultrasound machine function.
