Box 267.  Irvine, PA  16329Supervisor: Mark Twery 802-656-1716Throughout my tenure with the Forest Service, I have worked independently and with other programmers, both public and private, on a variety of software products.  I am the principal computer programmer for two computer based decision support systems being developed by the USDA Forest Service: NED and SILVAH.  The NED program provides site specific silvicultural prescriptions designed to promote a variety of management goals including: wildlife, timber production, aesthetics, water quality, pest management, and recreation.  The position requires significant coordination and communication with resource experts and computer programmers to incorporate their expertise and products into NED.  Currently, I am working on the third version of NED which is written entirely in C++.  The previous version (NED-2) used PROLOG to encode expert recommendations.  Programmers at the University of Georgia constructed the PROLOG code and I developed the user interface in C++.  I worked closely with faculty and graduate students to develop DLL protocols so the two languages could be merged into the single NED-2 program.  I have been the principal programmer on all NED versions.I began working on SIVLAH in 2012.  SILVAH, like NED, is a forest management expert system.  SILVAH is a legacy program that has been in use for decades.  I am responsible for program upgrades including migrating from a DOS program written in FORTRAN code to a Windows user-interface written in C++.  Most of the analysis is still carried out by the old legacy FORTRAN code, which has been modified to be recompiled into a DLL.In addition to the main SILVAH and NED there have been several stand-alone programs to convert forest inventory data to and from other software sources into both SILVAH and NED.  I have written routines to transfer data from ASCII files, Excel spreadsheets, Access databases and the Forest Service proprietary databases using SQL.I also wrote MIWILD and MIWILD-HAB2.  These two programs were written in conjunction with the Michigan Department of Natural Resources and are used to evaluate wildlife habitats.  The two programs were written in C++.  Additional support programs were required to populate the underlying database with wildlife information.  These programs were well received and I was asked to write similar programs for the state of Maryland.  Eventually I wrote a single program called NEDwild, which includes not only the Michigan and Maryland models, but also a model developed for Pennsylvania and one for the New England states.

Syracuse, NY 13210Supervisor: Dr. Ralph NylandThe majority of my work was focused on two stand-alone programs, the Forest Stewardship Planning Guide (FSPG) and NEWILD.  FSPG is targeted to landowners with little or no background in forestry.  The program aids the user in selecting management goals for their forested land.

Box 267.  Irvine, PA  16329Supervisor: Mark Twery 802-656-1716Throughout my tenure with the Forest Service, I have worked independently and with other programmers, both public and private, on a variety of software products.  I am the principal computer programmer for two computer based decision support systems being developed by the USDA Forest Service: NED and SILVAH.  The NED program provides site specific silvicultural prescriptions designed to promote a variety of management goals including: wildlife, timber production, aesthetics, water quality, pest management, and recreation.  The position requires significant coordination and communication with resource experts and computer programmers to incorporate their expertise and products into NED.  Currently, I am working on the third version of NED which is written entirely in C++.  The previous version (NED-2) used PROLOG to encode expert recommendations.  Programmers at the University of Georgia constructed the PROLOG code and I developed the user interface in C++.  I worked closely with faculty and graduate students to develop DLL protocols so the two languages could be merged into the single NED-2 program.  I have been the principal programmer on all NED versions.I began working on SIVLAH in 2012.  SILVAH, like NED, is a forest management expert system.  SILVAH is a legacy program that has been in use for decades.  I am responsible for program upgrades including migrating from a DOS program written in FORTRAN code to a Windows user-interface written in C++.  Most of the analysis is still carried out by the old legacy FORTRAN code, which has been modified to be recompiled into a DLL.In addition to the main SILVAH and NED there have been several stand-alone programs to convert forest inventory data to and from other software sources into both SILVAH and NED.  I have written routines to transfer data from ASCII files, Excel spreadsheets, Access databases and the Forest Service proprietary databases using SQL.I also wrote MIWILD and MIWILD-HAB2.  These two programs were written in conjunction with the Michigan Department of Natural Resources and are used to evaluate wildlife habitats.  The two programs were written in C++.  Additional support programs were required to populate the underlying database with wildlife information.  These programs were well received and I was asked to write similar programs for the state of Maryland.  Eventually I wrote a single program called NEDwild, which includes not only the Michigan and Maryland models, but also a model developed for Pennsylvania and one for the New England states.

Syracuse, NY 13210Supervisor: Dr. Ralph NylandThe majority of my work was focused on two stand-alone programs, the Forest Stewardship Planning Guide (FSPG) and NEWILD.  FSPG is targeted to landowners with little or no background in forestry.  The program aids the user in selecting management goals for their forested land.  NEWILD is a computerized version of the "New England Wildlife" publications by DeGraaf, Yamasaki, Leak and Lanier, and Rudis.  The software allows easy access and querying capabilities to information about animal species and their habitats.

I was project lead for several projects using remote sensing data to derive land cover maps.  This work was done using Sun Sparc I and II workstations and Silicon Graphic Indigo workstations networked to a SUN-390 file server.  Early work involved a VAX 11/785 mini-computer and several models of Tektronix graphic terminals (4107, 4111, 4125).  Commercial software included ERDAS, ARC/INFO, ELAS, and PCI image processing packages.  Most computer programs I wrote were in BASIC, FORTRAN and UNIX-C to supplement existing software or to transfer data between the commercial software systems.

I have written several programs dealing with data manipulation and have assisted in the development of several Geographic Information Systems (GIS).  A GIS is a specialized database management system that includes information about spatial location of ground features.  I was the lab supervisor at the National Science Foundation funded GIS Workshops conducted during the summer of 1988.  These workshops were targeted towards undergraduate faculty teaching GIS courses.  I provided the participants with hands-on experience on a microcomputer-based GIS.

Box 267.  Irvine, PA  16329Supervisor: Mark Twery 802-656-1716Throughout my tenure with the Forest Service, I have worked independently and with other programmers, both public and private, on a variety of software products.  I am the principal computer programmer for two computer based decision support systems being developed by the USDA Forest Service: NED and SILVAH.  The NED program provides site specific silvicultural prescriptions designed to promote a variety of management goals including: wildlife, timber production, aesthetics, water quality, pest management, and recreation.  The position requires significant coordination and communication with resource experts and computer programmers to incorporate their expertise and products into NED.  Currently, I am working on the third version of NED which is written entirely in C++.  The previous version (NED-2) used PROLOG to encode expert recommendations.  Programmers at the University of Georgia constructed the PROLOG code and I developed the user interface in C++.  I worked closely with faculty and graduate students to develop DLL protocols so the two languages could be merged into the single NED-2 program.  I have been the principal programmer on all NED versions.I began working on SIVLAH in 2012.  SILVAH, like NED, is a forest management expert system.  SILVAH is a legacy program that has been in use for decades.  I am responsible for program upgrades including migrating from a DOS program written in FORTRAN code to a Windows user-interface written in C++.  Most of the analysis is still carried out by the old legacy FORTRAN code, which has been modified to be recompiled into a DLL.In addition to the main SILVAH and NED there have been several stand-alone programs to convert forest inventory data to and from other software sources into both SILVAH and NED.  I have written routines to transfer data from ASCII files, Excel spreadsheets, Access databases and the Forest Service proprietary databases using SQL.I also wrote MIWILD and MIWILD-HAB2.  These two programs were written in conjunction with the Michigan Department of Natural Resources and are used to evaluate wildlife habitats.  The two programs were written in C++.  Additional support programs were required to populate the underlying database with wildlife information.  These programs were well received and I was asked to write similar programs for the state of Maryland.  Eventually I wrote a single program called NEDwild, which includes not only the Michigan and Maryland models, but also a model developed for Pennsylvania and one for the New England states.

NEWILD is a computerized version of the "New England Wildlife" publications by DeGraaf, Yamasaki, Leak and Lanier, and Rudis.  The software allows easy access and querying capabilities to information about animal species and their habitats.
