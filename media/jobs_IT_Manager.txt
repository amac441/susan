Using several Fluke tools I began testing many different cat5 cables. Many different vendors and specialized cables. Once I got a baseline for the cables I would then run them through temperature chambers and RF generators to see what would happen physically and electronically to the cables. To actually connect cat5 cable to the rest of the rocket systems I used Orcad to design specialized connectors that could be connected to the explosive disconnect systems they used on the rest of the rocket. Designed a battery test station for the rocket batteries. This station would rapidly discharge and charge four batteries at a time while it was monitoring the batteries internal temperatures and voltages. Using Orcad I designed a custom circuit board and cables that would connect the batteries to the test station.
